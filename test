The sun set quickly over the horizon.
She admired the Sun as it disappeared.
Birds chirped in the fading light.
The birds flew south for the winter.
Her favorite book was about birds.
The night grew colder.
Stars appeared in the dark sky.
Stars twinkled brightly.
A soft breeze rustled the leaves.
She saw a shooting star.
The wind whispered secrets.
The whisper was almost soothing.
Her cat sat by the window.
The Catâ€™s eyes gleamed in the dark.
She read a chapter about the stars.
The book fell to the floor.
It was a night for dreaming.
She dreamed of flying with the birds.
The next morning, the sun rose early.
