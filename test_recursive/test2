The sun is bright
Birds are singing
Flowers are blooming
The sky is blue
Children are playing
Trees sway gently
A breeze is refreshing
Grass is green
Bees are buzzing
Clouds float by
Leaves rustle softly
The air is crisp
The day is warm
Sunshine feels good
Butterflies flutter
Nature is beautiful
Colors are vivid
The park is lively
Picnics are common
Everyone is smiling
The lake is serene
Water is clear
Fish are swimming
Ripples form patterns
Boats gently sway
The shore is sandy
Footprints are left
The sand is warm
Shells are scattered
Waves gently crash
Seagulls soar high
The horizon is distant
Sunset paints the sky
Colors blend softly
Stars begin to appear
The night is calm
The moon shines bright
